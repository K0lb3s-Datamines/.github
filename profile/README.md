A small organisation to bundle my ([K0lb3](https://github.com/K0lb3)) own datamine projects for various games.
As I stopped playing all of the games or only ever mined them for fun, I don't maintain any of these projects anymore.
Please don't bother me regarding those, asking me to fix this or that which doesn't work anymore due to changes in these games.

Following ones aren't included here (as I don't want to bother to clone them):
- [Shinobi Nightmare](https://gitlab.com/K0lb3/shinobi-nightmare)
- [Phantom of the Kill](https://gitlab.com/K0lb3/phantom-of-the-kill)
- The Alchemist Code [new](https://github.com/K0lb3/The-Alchemist-Code---asset-downloader-and-extractor) [old](https://gitlab.com/the-alchemist-codes)
- [Crystal Re;Union](https://gitlab.com/K0lb3/crystal-reunion)
- [War of the VIsions](https://gitlab.com/war-of-the-visions)
- [Langrisser Mobile](https://gitlab.com/langrisser)
